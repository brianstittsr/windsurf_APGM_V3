### Step 2: Deploy Rules
1. Copy the entire contents of `firestore.rules` file
2. Paste into the Firebase Console rules editor
3. Click **Publish** to deploy

### Step 3: Verify Deployment
- Check that rules compile successfully
- Verify timestamp shows recent deployment
- Test basic read/write operations

## Method 2: Firebase CLI (Alternative)

```bash
# Login to Firebase
firebase login

# Deploy rules only
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules

# Or deploy everything
firebase deploy
```
