2. **Deploy to staging/production**
3. **Update environment variables** on deployment platform
4. **Test the new features** in the live environment

##  Important Considerations

### Environment Variables Setup
Before deploying, ensure these are configured:

**Facebook/Instagram Integration:**
`env
FACEBOOK_APP_ID=your_facebook_app_id
FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET=your_facebook_app_secret
FACEBOOK_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_facebook_access_token
FACEBOOK_PIXEL_ID=your_pixel_id
FACEBOOK_AD_ACCOUNT_ID=act_your_ad_account_id
INSTAGRAM_BUSINESS_ACCOUNT_ID=your_instagram_business_id
INSTAGRAM_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_instagram_token
`

**GoHighLevel Integration:**
`env
GOHIGHLEVEL_API_KEY=your_ghl_api_key
GOHIGHLEVEL_LOCATION_ID=your_ghl_location_id
`

### Database Setup
The new marketing collections will be created automatically, but ensure:
- Firestore security rules are deployed
- Admin permissions are set correctly

### Testing Priority
After deployment, test in this order:
1. Dashboard loads without errors
2. Marketing tab appears
3. Facebook/Instagram integrations connect
4. AI strategy generation works
5. Campaign creation functions
6. API endpoints respond correctly

##  Deployment Commands (after merge)

`ash
# Update local main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Deploy to Vercel (if using Vercel)
vercel --prod

# Or deploy to your hosting platform
# npm run build && npm run start
`

##  Troubleshooting

### If Merge Conflicts Occur:
`ash
# Abort merge and resolve conflicts
git merge --abort
# Then resolve conflicts manually or rebase

# Alternative: Create new branch from main and cherry-pick
git checkout main
git checkout -b feature/resolved-conflicts
git cherry-pick <commit-hashes-from-feature-branch>
`

### If Build Fails After Merge:
1. Check for missing dependencies in package.json
2. Verify environment variables are set
3. Check for TypeScript compilation errors
4. Ensure all imports are correct

##  Support

If you encounter any issues during the merge:
1. Check the PR for any failing checks
2. Review error logs in deployment platform
3. Verify all environment variables are set
4. Test locally before deploying to production

The merge process is straightforward - the comprehensive marketing suite is ready to enhance your lead generation capabilities!
