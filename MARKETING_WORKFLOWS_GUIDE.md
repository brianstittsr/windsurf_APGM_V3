## üîß Technical Integration

### **Automatic Triggers**

The system automatically triggers workflows when:

```typescript
// New client registration
await triggerNewClientWorkflow(userId, userEmail);

// Appointment booking
await triggerAppointmentBookedWorkflow(userId, userEmail, {
  appointmentId,
  serviceType: selectedService.name,
  appointmentDate: selectedDate,
  artistId: selectedArtistId
});

// Appointment completion
await triggerAppointmentCompletedWorkflow(userId, userEmail, {
  appointmentId,
  serviceType,
  completedDate,
  artistId
});
```

### **Manual Triggers**

You can also trigger workflows manually:

```typescript
import { useWorkflowTrigger } from '@/hooks/useWorkflowTrigger';

const { triggerWorkflow } = useWorkflowTrigger();

await triggerWorkflow({
  trigger: 'manual',
  userId: 'client-id',
  userEmail: 'client@email.com',
  additionalData: {
    reason: 'Special promotion',
    campaign: 'summer-2024'
  }
});
```

## üìß Email Service Integration

### **Current Setup**
- Emails are logged to Firebase for tracking
- Ready for integration with email service providers

### **Production Integration**
To send actual emails, integrate with services like:

#### **SendGrid Integration**
```typescript
// In WorkflowEngine.ts - executeEmailStep method
import sgMail from '@sendgrid/mail';

sgMail.setApiKey(process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY);

const msg = {
  to: execution.userEmail,
  from: 'noreply@aprettygirl.com',
  subject: step.subject,
  html: step.content,
};

await sgMail.send(msg);
```

#### **Mailgun Integration**
```typescript
import Mailgun from 'mailgun.js';

const mailgun = new Mailgun(FormData);
const mg = mailgun.client({
  username: 'api',
  key: process.env.MAILGUN_API_KEY
});

await mg.messages.create('your-domain.com', {
  from: 'A Pretty Girl Matter <noreply@aprettygirl.com>',
  to: execution.userEmail,
  subject: step.subject,
  html: step.content
});
```

## üì± SMS Service Integration

### **Twilio Integration**
```typescript
// In WorkflowEngine.ts - executeSMSStep method
import twilio from 'twilio';

const client = twilio(
  process.env.TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID,
  process.env.TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN
);

await client.messages.create({
  body: step.content,
  from: process.env.TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER,
  to: phoneNumber
});
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env.local` file:

```env
# Email Service (choose one)
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_key
MAILGUN_API_KEY=your_mailgun_key
MAILGUN_DOMAIN=your_mailgun_domain

# SMS Service
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_token
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=your_twilio_number

# Workflow Settings
WORKFLOW_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
WORKFLOW_FROM_NAME="A Pretty Girl Matter"
```

## üîÑ Automated Scheduling

### **Cron Job Setup**

For production deployment, set up a cron job to process scheduled workflows:

#### **Vercel Cron (vercel.json)**
```json
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/workflow-scheduler",
      "schedule": "*/15 * * * *"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### **Manual Cron Setup**
```bash
# Run every 15 minutes
*/15 * * * * curl -X POST https://yourdomain.com/api/workflow-scheduler
```

## üìä Analytics and Reporting

### **Built-in Metrics**
- Workflow enrollment rates
- Email open/click rates (when integrated)
- SMS delivery rates
- Completion percentages
- Revenue attribution
- Client engagement scores

### **Custom Analytics**
Extend the analytics system by:
1. Adding custom tracking events
2. Integrating with Google Analytics
3. Creating custom reports
4. Exporting data for external analysis

## üé® Customization

### **Workflow Templates**
Create custom templates by modifying the `workflowTemplates` array in `MarketingWorkflows.tsx`:

```typescript
const customTemplate: WorkflowTemplate = {
  id: 'custom-follow-up',
  name: 'Custom Follow-up Sequence',
  description: 'Tailored follow-up for specific services',
  category: 'nurturing',
  workflow: {
    name: 'Custom Follow-up Sequence',
    description: 'Custom workflow description',
    trigger: 'manual',
    isActive: true,
    steps: [
      // Define your custom steps here
    ]
  }
};
```

### **Step Types**
Add new step types by extending the `WorkflowStep` interface and implementing handlers in `WorkflowEngine.ts`.

### **UI Customization**
Modify the visual appearance by updating the CSS classes and styles in the component files.

## üîí Security Considerations

### **Data Privacy**
- All client data is stored securely in Firebase
- Email content is encrypted in transit
- SMS messages are logged but not stored permanently
- GDPR compliance features available

### **Access Control**
- Only admin users can create/edit workflows
- Workflow execution logs are access-controlled
- API endpoints require proper authentication

## üö® Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

#### **Workflows Not Triggering**
1. Check if the workflow is active
2. Verify trigger conditions are met
3. Check Firebase connection
4. Review execution logs in the admin dashboard

#### **Emails Not Sending**
1. Verify email service API keys
2. Check spam folders
3. Review email logs in Firebase
4. Validate email addresses

#### **SMS Not Delivering**
1. Confirm Twilio credentials
2. Check phone number format
3. Verify SMS service balance
4. Review SMS logs

### **Debug Mode**
Enable debug logging by setting:
```env
WORKFLOW_DEBUG=true
```
