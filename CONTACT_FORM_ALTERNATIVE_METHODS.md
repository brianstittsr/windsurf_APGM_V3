# Contact Form - Alternative Email Methods Implementation

## Problem Solved
The contact form was experiencing issues with Resend SDK not sending form details and CC messages properly. Implemented multiple fallback email methods for reliability.

## New Implementation

### Method 1: Resend API via Fetch (Primary)
- Uses direct HTTP calls to Resend API instead of SDK
- Properly handles CC to both Victoria and Brian
- Includes all form details in structured HTML format

### Method 2: FormSubmit Webhook (Fallback)
- Free service that forwards form submissions via email
- Automatically includes CC functionality
- No API key required
- Formats data in table format for easy reading

## Email Flow

### Notification Email (TO: victoria@aprettygirlmatter.com)
- **CC:** brianstittsr@gmail.com
- **Subject:** "New Contact Form Submission from [Name]"
- **Content:** All form details (name, email, phone, service, message)
- **Reply-To:** Customer's email address

### Confirmation Email (TO: Customer)
- **Subject:** "Thank you for contacting A Pretty Girl Matter!"
- **Content:** Thank you message with next steps and contact info

## Reliability Features

1. **Dual Method Approach:**
   - Primary: Resend API via fetch
   - Fallback: FormSubmit webhook service

2. **Comprehensive Logging:**
   - All submissions logged regardless of email success
   - Detailed error tracking for debugging

3. **Graceful Degradation:**
   - Form always accepts submissions
   - User gets success message even if email fails
   - All data preserved for manual follow-up

## Configuration

### Environment Variables Required:
```bash
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_api_key_here
```

### No Additional Setup Needed:
- FormSubmit works without configuration
- Automatic fallback if Resend fails

## Testing

Run the test script to verify functionality:
```bash
npm run test-contact
```
