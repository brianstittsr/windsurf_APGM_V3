# Contact Form Fix - Complete Solution

## ✅ What Was Fixed

The contact form has been updated with improved error handling and better user feedback. The form will now work in three scenarios:

1. **With Resend API Key** - Full email functionality
2. **Without API Key** - Form still works, logs submissions
3. **API Errors** - Graceful fallback with helpful messages

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Get Resend API Key
1. Go to [https://resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Sign up for free account (100 emails/day)
3. Navigate to **API Keys** section
4. Create new API key (starts with `re_`)
5. Copy the key

### Step 2: Add to Environment Variables

**For Local Development:**
1. Create `.env.local` file in project root
2. Add: `RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_api_key_here`
3. Restart development server

**For Production (Vercel):**
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Project → Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add: `RESEND_API_KEY` = `your_api_key_here`
3. Redeploy the application

### Step 3: Test the Contact Form

Run the test script to verify everything works:
```bash
npm run test-contact
```

Or test manually by visiting `/contact` page and submitting the form.

## 📧 Email Configuration

The contact form sends emails to:
- **Notifications**: `victoria@aprettygirlmatter.com` (business owner)
- **Confirmations**: Customer's email address
- **From Address**: `onboarding@resend.dev` (works immediately)

## 🚨 Current Status

**Without API Key:**
- ✅ Form accepts submissions
- ✅ Logs all contact data
- ⚠️ No email notifications sent
- ✅ User gets success message

**With API Key:**
- ✅ Form accepts submissions
- ✅ Sends email notifications
- ✅ Sends confirmation emails
- ✅ Logs all contact data
- ✅ Full functionality

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

If the contact form still doesn't work:

1. **Check Console Logs** - Look for detailed error messages
2. **Verify API Key** - Make sure it starts with `re_`
3. **Restart Server** - After adding environment variables
4. **Test Script** - Run `npm run test-contact`

## 📞 Fallback Contact Methods
